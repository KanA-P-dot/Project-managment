# Project-managment
Team project

Sprint #1:
1/Presentation of the objectives of our project  

- We chose this project because we think that school websites are not up to date, in the digital age students should all have a well done and complete website!

-Our main goal is to develop a site like pronote in improved, that is to say a site where students will be able to do simple things like see their timetables or their grades but also see the news of their schools, register for a sport and many other things.

-Our site is an example of our services as our team creates websites for education.
In this case, on our site the student can see his grades, his timetable but he can also register to a sports association of his school or to other events.
On the site they will be able to follow the latest news, talk with their teachers and much more!

2/Website architecture plan

-At the moment the site is designed so that when you arrive on the first page you can see the timetable and the latest news.
The student can also click on the navigation bar to go to the 'Message' and 'Life in campus' pages.

-The rubrics are created.

3/Project Creation

-First we made the homepage with a header, a body and a footer.
In the second sprint we hope to make a complete site with all pages, this would give us time to do as much js as possible and try to use sql for accounts/connections.
