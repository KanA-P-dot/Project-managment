# Project-managment
Team project

Sprint #1:
1/Presentation of the objectives of our project  

-We chose this project because we believe that school websites are not up to date, in the digital age students should all have a well made and complete website!

-Our main goal is to develop a site like pronote in improved, that is to say a site where students will be able to do simple things like see their timetables or their grades but also see the news of their schools, register for a sport and many other things.

-Our site is an example of our services as our team creates websites for education.
In this case, on our site the student can see his grades, his timetable but he can also register for a school sports association or other events.
On the site they can follow the latest news, chat with their teachers and much more!

2/Website architecture plan

-For the moment, the site is designed so that when you arrive on the first page, you can see the schedule and the latest news.
The student can also click on the navigation bar to access the "Messages" and "Campus Life" pages.

-The headings are created.

3/Project Creation

-First we created the homepage with a header, body and footer.
In the second sprint we hope to make a full site taking into account the mistakes of sprint 1. Before the oral we can review improvements and prepare.

-Trello.

-

-The tasks on our site were divided up randomly, when someone had an idea they would propose it to the group and implement it.
We all want to learn and we all have ideas, so we move through the different pages at different speeds.

4/First Website design steps

-For the design of our website we were inspired by existing school websites, for the css we used coolors.co a website that combines colours that go well together.

-The architecture of the site is made with two basic folders assets and src, in assets there are image files and in src there are html and css documents.
