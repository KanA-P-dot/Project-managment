# Project-managment
Team project

Sprint #1:
1/Presentation of the objectives of our project  

-We chose this project because we believe that school websites are not up to date, in the digital age students should all have a well made and complete website!

-Our main goal is to develop a site like pronote in improved, that is to say a site where students will be able to do simple things like see their timetables or their grades but also see the news of their schools, register for a sport and many other things.
