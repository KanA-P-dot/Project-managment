# Project-managment
Team project

Sprint #1:
1/Presentation of the objectives of our project  

-We chose this project because we believe that school websites are not up to date, in the digital age students should all have a well made and complete website!

-Our main goal is to develop a site like pronote in improved, that is to say a site where students will be able to do simple things like see their timetables or their grades but also see the news of their schools, register for a sport and many other things.

-Our site is an example of our services as our team creates websites for education.
In this case, on our site the student can see his grades, his timetable but he can also register for a school sports association or other events.
On the site they can follow the latest news, chat with their teachers and much more!
